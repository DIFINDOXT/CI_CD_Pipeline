# Challenges Faced - Spring Boot CI/CD Pipeline Project

This document provides a comprehensive log of all technical challenges encountered during the CI/CD pipeline implementation, along with attempted solutions and lessons learned.

## üöß Infrastructure & Cost Management

### 1. AWS EC2 Billing Escalation
**Issue**: Project costs exceeded expected budget (~‚Çπ200 for t2.xlarge)
- **Root Cause**: Extended troubleshooting sessions (10+ hours vs planned 3 hours)
- **Impact**: Project had to be paused due to billing constraints
- **Lesson**: Always set billing alerts and use cost-effective alternatives for learning projects
- **Future Strategy**: Consider GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or local Docker Desktop setup

### 2. Disk Space Exhaustion
**Issue**: EC2 instance ran out of disk space during builds
- **Symptoms**: "No space left on device" errors, Jenkins node offline
- **Root Cause**: Maven cache, Docker images, and Jenkins workspace consuming ~95% disk
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - `docker system prune -a` - Removed unused containers and images
  - `mvn clean` - Cleared Maven build artifacts
  - Manual workspace cleanup in Jenkins
- **Result**: Temporarily freed ~1.6GB but insufficient for continued operations
- **Lesson**: Provision adequate storage or implement automated cleanup scripts

## üîß Jenkins Configuration & Pipeline Issues

### 3. Docker Socket Permission Denied
**Issue**: Jenkins couldn't communicate with Docker daemon
- **Error**: `permission denied while trying to connect to Docker daemon socket`
- **Root Cause**: Jenkins user not in docker group
- **Fix**: Added Jenkins user to docker group: `sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins`
- **Additional**: Restarted Jenkins service after group modification

### 4. Java Version Compatibility Matrix
**Issue**: Multiple Java version conflicts across tools
- **Jenkins**: Running Java 11
- **Spring Boot App**: Required Java 17
- **SonarQube**: Needed Java 17, but agent used Java 11
- **Maven**: Version mismatch causing build failures
- **Solution Attempted**:
  - Installed OpenJDK 17 via `apt install openjdk-17-jdk`
  - Set default Java using `update-alternatives --config java`
  - Modified `JAVA_HOME` in Jenkins configuration
- **Lesson**: Maintain consistent Java versions across entire toolchain

### 5. Node Executor Availability
**Issue**: "Waiting for next available executor" indefinitely
- **Root Cause**: Combination of disk space and node offline status
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Manually cleaned Jenkins workspace
  - Restarted Jenkins service
  - Configured additional executors
- **Result**: Temporary relief but recurring due to underlying disk issues

## üß™ SonarQube Integration Challenge Issues

### 6. SonarQube Java Plugin Compatibility
**Issue**: Java version mismatch preventing analysis
- **Problem**: SonarQube required Java 17, but Jenkins agent used Java 11
- **Attempted Fix**: Modified Jenkins agent configuration
- **Complication**: Custom Docker image rebuild required
- **Status**: Pending resolution in project continuation

---

## üì¶ Docker & Containerization Issues

### 7. Docker Agent Image Mismatch
**Issue**: Jenkins Docker agent couldn't build Java 17 application
- **Root Cause**: Using trainer's Java 11 based image for Java 17 project
- **Solution**: Created custom Docker image with Java 17 support
- **Docker Commands Used**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t shubhadeep/jenkins-agent:java17 .
  docker push shubhadeep/jenkins-agent:java17
  ```
- **Fallback**: Used `maven:3.9.6-temurin-17` as temporary solution

### 8. Container Resource Constraints
**Issue**: Docker containers failing due to memory/CPU limits
- **Symptoms**: Build timeouts, container crashes
- **Root Cause**: t2.xlarge instance resource exhaustion
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Reduced concurrent builds
  - Optimized Docker image size
  - Cleared container logs
- **Result**: Marginal improvement but persistent issues

## üîê ArgoCD Deployment & Access Issues

### 9. ArgoCD Operator Installation Problems
**Issue**: ArgoCD UI login authentication failure
- **Installation Method**: Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
- **Problem**: Default admin credentials not working
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Retrieved admin password from secret: `kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret`
  - Tried password reset procedures
  - Attempted token-based authentication
  - Checked ArgoCD server logs for authentication errors
- **Status**: Unresolved after 2+ hours of troubleshooting
- **Alternative Considered**: Direct YAML installation instead of operator

### 10. Kubernetes Connectivity Issues
**Issue**: ArgoCD couldn't connect to target Kubernetes cluster
- **Environment**: Minikube local cluster
- **Network Issues**: Service discovery and port forwarding problems
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Verified Minikube status and connectivity
  - Checked service ports and endpoints
  - Attempted port forwarding for ArgoCD UI
- **Status**: Partially resolved but login issues persisted

---

## üìä Monitoring & Alerting Gaps

### 11. Slack Integration Incomplete
**Issue**: Slack notifications not implemented
- **Root Cause**: Project paused before reaching notification phase
- **Planned Implementation**: Jenkins Slack plugin with webhook integration
- **Status**: Documented for future implementation

### 12. Pipeline Monitoring Missing
**Issue**: No centralized monitoring for pipeline health
- **Gap**: No metrics collection or alerting for failed builds
- **Future Plan**: Implement Jenkins metrics and dashboards

## üí° Key Learnings & Best Practices

### Technical Insights:
1. **Environment Consistency**: Maintain same Java version across all tools
2. **Resource Planning**: Always provision 20-30% extra disk space for CI/CD
3. **Cost Management**: Use billing alerts and consider free-tier alternatives
4. **Troubleshooting**: Document each issue and solution for future reference

### Process Improvements:
1. **Testing Strategy**: Test each component individually before integration
2. **Documentation**: Maintain real-time issue logs during implementation
3. **Backup Plans**: Have alternative approaches for critical components
4. **Time Boxing**: Set strict time limits for troubleshooting sessions

### DevOps Maturity:
1. **Failure Handling**: Document incomplete projects professionally
2. **Cost Awareness**: Balance learning goals with budget constraints
3. **Problem Solving**: Systematic debugging approach with root cause analysis
4. **Continuous Learning**: Convert challenges into interview preparation material
